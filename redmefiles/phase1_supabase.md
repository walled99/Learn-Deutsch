# 📘 Supabase Setup Documentation

**Project:** LernDeutsch AI

This document describes the exact steps to initialize, configure, and secure the Supabase backend for the LernDeutsch AI project.

---

## Step 1: Initialize the Project

### 1.1 Create a Supabase Project
- Open the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/).
- Click **New Project** and follow the instructions.

### 1.2 Save Credentials Securely
After project creation, securely store the following:
- **Project Password**
- **Anon API Key**
- **Service Role API Key**

> ⚠️ These keys are required for backend access and **must never be exposed publicly**.

### 1.3 Set Project Region
- **Region:** Frankfurt (eu-central-1)  
- **Reason:** Hosting in Frankfurt reduces latency for Germany-focused users.

---

## Step 2: Define the Database Schema (SQL Editor)

All database structures are created using the **Supabase SQL Editor**.

### 2.1 Purpose
This schema:
- Enforces strict data integrity
- Matches functional requirements FR-3.2 and FR-5
- Prevents duplicate vocabulary entries
- Links all user data to Supabase Auth users

### 2.2 Create Custom ENUM Types

sql
CREATE TYPE word_category AS ENUM ('Noun', 'Verb', 'Adjective', 'Adverb', 'Phrase');
CREATE TYPE mastery_status AS ENUM ('New', 'Learning', 'Reviewing', 'Mastered');
CREATE TYPE gender_article AS ENUM ('der', 'die', 'das');
CREATE TYPE helper_verb AS ENUM ('haben', 'sein');
2.3 Create the vocabulary Table
CREATE TABLE vocabulary (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  word TEXT NOT NULL,
  article gender_article,
  plural TEXT,
  helper_verb helper_verb,
  past_participle TEXT,
  translation TEXT NOT NULL,
  example TEXT,
  category word_category NOT NULL,
  status mastery_status DEFAULT 'New',
  image_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, word, category)  -- Prevent duplicate entries for the same user
);
Key Design Decisions:

Each vocabulary entry belongs to one authenticated user.

UNIQUE(user_id, word, category) prevents duplicates per user.

Optional grammar fields support German language structure.

image_url links vocabulary back to source images.

2.4 Create the profiles Table
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  display_name TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
Step 3: Security & Row Level Security (RLS)
3.1 Purpose
Users must never see or modify other users’ data.

3.2 Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE vocabulary ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
3.3 Create Vocabulary Access Policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own vocabulary"
ON vocabulary
FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
Effect:

Full isolation between users

Queries are automatically filtered by auth.uid()

No client-side filtering required

Step 4: Storage Setup (Image Capture)
Navigate to Storage in Supabase.

Create a bucket named: source-images

Set visibility to Private

Only the uploading user should access their images.

Step 5: Storage Policies
Ensure users:

Can upload images

Can view only their own images

Cannot access other users’ files

5.1 Create the "Insert" (Upload) Policy
Click New Policy → Full Customization

Policy Name: Allow authenticated uploads

Allowed Operations: INSERT

Target Roles: authenticated

Check Expression: auth.uid() = owner

Save policy.

5.2 Create the "Select" (View) Policy
Click New Policy → Full Customization

Policy Name: Allow users to view own images

Allowed Operations: SELECT

Target Roles: authenticated

Check Expression: auth.uid() = owner

Save policy.

5.3 Policy Summary
Policy Type	Operation	Who Can Do It	Which Files
Insert	Upload	Authenticated users	Only files they own
Select	View	Authenticated users	Only files they uploaded
✅ Final Result
Each user has fully isolated data.

Vocabulary is structured, validated, and duplicate-safe.

Images are securely stored and access-controlled.

Backend supports OCR + Gemini processing.

Supabase Auth, Database, RLS, and Storage are fully integrated.
